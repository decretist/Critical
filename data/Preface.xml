        <p>The text of the rubrics for 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 is quite similar in all
        four R1 mss., and substantially different from the readings reported in
        Fr. 4.6.1: "Qui in accusatione episcopi culpabilis inuenitur ad
        arguendum de cetero non admittatur nisi propriam causam ciuilem
        solummodo asserere uoluerit" in Aa Bc Fd P, and "In ciuili et proprio
        dumtaxat negotio ad arguendum admittitur, qui in episcopi accusatione
        culpabilis inuenitur" in Fr. 4.6.2: "Non negatur audientia in propria
        causa cuius accusatio interdicitur" in Aa Bc Fd P, and "Propriam causam
        agere ualet cui accusare non licet" in Fr.</p>
        <p> C.4 q.2-3 d.p.c.3 quotes a cryptic statement, not found in Clavis
        Canonum, attributed to St. Brice (†.444), a controversial disciple of
        St. Martin, and his successor as bishop of Tours.
        <note place="foot">"It is remarkable that in his dicta Gratian refers
        to sources that are not cited in the Decretum. Many biblical citations,
        for example, are found only in the dicta. They are often tied to
        important theological reflections ..."

        <!-- Admont (Aa) -->
        <p>There are two marginal glosses in the Aa text of C.4 that refer to
        Burchard's <title level="m">Decretum</title>: "B.xvi. Nemo ſimul ſit."
        (Burchard 16.15) at 4.4.1, and "B.i. Qͥſqͥs." (Burchard 1.160) at 4.6.1.
        A rubric in between C.4 and C.5 ("Explicit liber quintus, incipit liber
        sextus, de episcoporum accusationibus") indicates a non-standard
        division of Aa into books.</p>
        <!-- Barcelona (Bc) -->
        <p>The order of rubrics in C.4 q.4 is reversed in Bc. The rubric for
        4.4.2 ("Quilibet in causa duas personas gerere non valet") appears
        before 4.4.1, and the rubric for 4.4.1 ("Accusator, testis vel iudex
        aliquis simul esse non potest") appears before 4.4.2. Bc includes two
        canons —  4.6.3 and 4.6.4 — not listed in Winroth's appendix and not
        found in either Aa or P.</p>
        <!-- Paris (P) -->
        <p>The quality of scribal workmanship in P is visibly less professional
        than that in either Aa or Bc.</p>
        <!-- cf. Mantello and Rigg -->
        <p>In addition to scribal errors, Aa, Bc, and P reflect divergence from
        Classical Latin orthography for
        <hi rend="italic">ci</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ti</hi>. Aa: spacium;
        Bc: defitiens, iuditio and iuditium, and prouintie; and P: accionis,
        audiencia, and tercio.</p>

                An excommunicate undertook to accuse a bishop. He brought a
                person under the age of 14 to support his case. [assertio was
                originally used to mean the defense of a person’s character. In
                the middle ages the word took on a modern meaning of assertion.
                It retained its positive meaning—i.e. it was a statement in favor
                of something. Here, I think it means that the accuser brought the
                young person in to support his accusation against the bishop.]
                Prohibited from making the accusation [because he was an
                excommunicate], he made [introduced, assigned] the adolescent the
                accuser and himself the witness. [In other words, the
                excommunicate switched roles with the youth, but the next sentence
                raises a question about the meaning of se here.] The adolescent
                began to act as accuser and witness. On the appointed day, the
                bishop did not agree [minime concurrit] to come before the
                electors’ [those chosen to be judges] court. He was suspended from
                communion. Finally, the court having been reconvened, the accuser
                [I believe this refers to the youth] was found culpable in making
                the accusation. In the end, he [I believe this person is the
                original accuser, the excommunicate] proceeded to make his case.
