        The most interesting text in the case is Gratian's one and
        only <hi rend="italic">dictum</hi>, C.4 q.2-3 d.p.c.3. "Set
        obicitur illud beati Bricii, qui uoce pueri xxx dies ab
        ortu habentis innocens probatus est. Set miracula diuina
        sunt admiranda, non in exemplum humane actionis trahenda."
        The Latin of the first sentence is somewhat opaque. Taking
        the accusative plural <hi rend="italic">dies</hi> as the
        object of <hi rend="italic">habentis</hi>, and supplying
        <hi rend="italic">exemplum</hi> because it is neuter and
        can be construed with <hi rend="italic">illud</hi>, the
        sentence can be literally translated as "But that [example]
        of blessed Brice is objected, who was proved innocent by
        the voice of the child having thirty days from its birth
        or origin." The dictum can be translated into more idiomatic
        English as "But a counter-example is that of St. Brice, who
        was proved innocent by the word of a thirty-day-old child.
        But divine miracles are to be wondered at, not to be taken
        as a pattern for human action."
        </p>
        <p>
        Gratian is referring to a story from Gregory of Tours,
        <title level="m">History of the Franks</title>, II.1, about
        St. Brice (†.444), St. Martin's controversial immediate
        successor as bishop of Tours. This is the only mention of
        Brice in the <title level="m">Decretum</title>, and
        <title level="m">History of the Franks</title> falls outside
        what we normally consider to be the boundaries of Gratian's
        formal or material sources. (Friedberg attributes the story
        to the <title level="m">Life of St. Martin</title> by
        Sulpicius Severus, although he really seems to have had in
        mind an unrelated story from the third book of Sulpicius's
        <title level="m">Dialogues</title> in which Marin compares
        Brice to Judas. In any event Friedberg was wrong, the proper
        attribution is to Gregory.) Gregory relates the story of a
        nun or consecrated virgin serving as a laundress for Brice's
        episcopal household who became pregnant and delivered a
        child. The people of Tours, with whom Brice was already
        quite unpopular, suspected that he was the father. Brice
        had the thirty-day-old infant brought to him, and questioned
        the child publicly concerning his paternity. Through the
        saint's miraculous intervention, the child spoke plainly,
        answering that Brice was not its father.

        <p>
        The <hi rend="italic">dictum</hi> is relevant in its immediate
        context, since Gratian is concluding his treatment of the
        second question, whether someone under the age of fourteen
        is able to testify in a criminal case. But Gratian's reference
        to this obscure story also seems intended to caution against
        depending on miracles as a regular part of criminal procedure,
        and by extension implies a negative judgement on the validity
        of trial by ordeal.

        <note place="foot">"It is remarkable that in his dicta
        Gratian refers to sources that are not cited in the Decretum.
        Many biblical citations, for example, are found only in the
        dicta. They are often tied to important theological reflections
        ..." (Landau, "Gratian and the Decretum Gratiani", 41.)</note>

        <!-- 4.4.1 -->
        <!-- 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 rubrics -->
        <p>The text of the rubrics for 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 is quite similar in all
        four R1 mss., and substantially different from the readings reported in
        Fr. 4.6.1: "Qui in accusatione episcopi culpabilis inuenitur ad
        arguendum de cetero non admittatur nisi propriam causam ciuilem
        solummodo asserere uoluerit" in Aa Bc Fd P, and "In ciuili et proprio
        dumtaxat negotio ad arguendum admittitur, qui in episcopi accusatione
        culpabilis inuenitur" in Fr. 4.6.2: "Non negatur audientia in propria
        causa cuius accusatio interdicitur" in Aa Bc Fd P, and "Propriam causam
        agere ualet cui accusare non licet" in Fr.</p>
        <!-- Admont (Aa) -->
        <p>There are two marginal glosses in the Aa text of C.4 that refer to
        Burchard's <title level="m">Decretum</title>: "B.xvi. Nemo ſimul ſit."
        (Burchard 16.15) at 4.4.1, and "B.i. Qͥſqͥs." (Burchard 1.160) at 4.6.1.
        A rubric in between C.4 and C.5 ("Explicit liber quintus, incipit liber
        sextus, de episcoporum accusationibus") indicates a non-standard
        division of Aa into books.</p>
        <!-- Barcelona (Bc) -->
        <p>The order of rubrics in C.4 q.4 is reversed in Bc. The rubric for

        before 4.4.1, and the rubric for 4.4.1 ("Accusator, testis vel iudex
        aliquis simul esse non potest") appears before 4.4.2. Bc includes two
        canons —  4.6.3 and 4.6.4 — not listed in Winroth's appendix and not
        found in either Aa or P.</p>

                An excommunicate undertook to accuse a bishop. He brought a
                person under the age of 14 to support his case. [assertio was
                originally used to mean the defense of a person’s character. In
                the middle ages the word took on a modern meaning of assertion.
                It retained its positive meaning—i.e. it was a statement in favor
                of something. Here, I think it means that the accuser brought the
                young person in to support his accusation against the bishop.]
                Prohibited from making the accusation [because he was an
                excommunicate], he made [introduced, assigned] the adolescent the
                accuser and himself the witness. [In other words, the
                excommunicate switched roles with the youth, but the next sentence
                raises a question about the meaning of se here.] The adolescent
                began to act as accuser and witness. On the appointed day, the
                bishop did not agree [minime concurrit] to come before the
                electors’ [those chosen to be judges] court. He was suspended from
                communion. Finally, the court having been reconvened, the accuser
                [I believe this refers to the youth] was found culpable in making
                the accusation. In the end, he [I believe this person is the
                original accuser, the excommunicate] proceeded to make his case.
